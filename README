QrCodeContainer creates a QR-code image. Just add a div and add the content that should be encoded to the QR-code.
Most of the times I think you'd like a web address here.

You can also give the wicket Page instead of text. You'll get the link generated.

The JavaScript is NOT mine
Have a look at:

What I did is make sure there is a Wicket WebMarkupContainer which now has this jQuery. In the pom maven minify plugin is used to pack these javascript files into one file and also minify it. So in this package you will not see the javascript files which are downloaded from the site named above.
